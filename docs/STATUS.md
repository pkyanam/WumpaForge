# Status — 2026-09-08

## Goal
Run the supplied game natively on Apple Silicon without emulation. **Not running.**

## Environment
- Workspace started with only a 931 MiB ISO and `.DS_Store`; initialized Git on `main`.
- Host reports arm64. Xcode beta, Homebrew, Python 3, CMake, and SDL2 are present.
- Input: `Crash Bandicoot - The Wrath of Cortex (USA).iso` (preserved in place).
- `file` reports ISO 9660; exact platform/version still requires disc inspection.

## Initial upstream findings
- https://github.com/Open-Travelers/OpenCrashWOC : GameCube-derived C reimplementation,
  no releases, README says gamecode 70%, build WIP, incomplete engine and dummy sound.
- https://github.com/denzi-gh/crashwoc-decomp-ps2 : active matching decompilation targeting
  PAL v1.03 SLES-50386, not a native host port. No releases.
- https://github.com/denzi-gh/crashwoc-decomp-gc : matching GameCube USA decompilation,
  no releases; branches include multiplayer and custom text, no advertised native port.
- https://github.com/calmsacibis995/crash-ps2 : USA v1.00 project explicitly unbuildable
  and very incomplete.

## Confirmed disc / selected approach
- Original Xbox XDVDFS at partition base 0; the ISO9660 descriptor is a dummy.
- Extracted only `default.xbe` (1,777,664 bytes) to `local/assets/`.
- Title `Crash Bandicoot: tWoC`, ID `0x56550003`, North America, certificate version 1.
- Build 2002-03-19, XDK 4361, entry point `0x000EF089`, 113 kernel imports.
- Inventory and XBE analysis in `local/reports/`; about 972 MB of file contents on disc.
- OpenCrashWOC CMake configures but compile fails immediately on incomplete C;
  it still uses GameCube GX and is not an available native game implementation.
- User explicitly accepts native ARM64 ahead-of-time recompiled game code using
  compatibility layers for Xbox graphics, audio, and system calls.
- Selected `third_party/xboxrecomp` (revision in UPSTREAM.md). No CPU emulation/JIT.
- Python venv installed only Capstone 5.0.7 (native arm64 wheel).

## Next
Finish disassembly, identify functions, lift to C, and build a macOS ARM64 host.
Resolve startup failures iteratively. No game process is currently running.
