# Status — 2026-09-08

## Goal
Run the supplied game natively on Apple Silicon without emulation. **Native startup runs; game title/menu not yet reached.**

## Environment
- Workspace started with only a 931 MiB ISO and `.DS_Store`; initialized Git on `main`.
- Host reports arm64. Xcode beta, Homebrew, Python 3, CMake, and SDL2 are present.
- Input: `Crash Bandicoot - The Wrath of Cortex (USA).iso` (preserved in place).
- Original Xbox XDVDFS confirmed; ISO 9660 is a dummy descriptor.

## Initial upstream findings
- https://github.com/Open-Travelers/OpenCrashWOC : GameCube-derived C reimplementation,
  no releases, README says gamecode 70%, build WIP, incomplete engine and dummy sound.
- https://github.com/denzi-gh/crashwoc-decomp-ps2 : active matching decompilation targeting
  PAL v1.03 SLES-50386, not a native host port. No releases.
- https://github.com/denzi-gh/crashwoc-decomp-gc : matching GameCube USA decompilation,
  no releases; branches include multiplayer and custom text, no advertised native port.
- https://github.com/calmsacibis995/crash-ps2 : USA v1.00 project explicitly unbuildable
  and very incomplete.

## Confirmed disc / selected approach
- Original Xbox XDVDFS at partition base 0; the ISO9660 descriptor is a dummy.
- Extracted only `default.xbe` (1,777,664 bytes) to `local/assets/`.
- Title `Crash Bandicoot: tWoC`, ID `0x56550003`, North America, certificate version 1.
- Build 2002-03-19, XDK 4361, entry point `0x000EF089`, 113 kernel imports.
- Inventory and XBE analysis in `local/reports/`; about 972 MB of file contents on disc.
- OpenCrashWOC CMake configures but compile fails immediately on incomplete C;
  it still uses GameCube GX and is not an available native game implementation.
- User explicitly accepts native ARM64 ahead-of-time recompiled game code using
  compatibility layers for Xbox graphics, audio, and system calls.
- Selected `third_party/xboxrecomp` (revision in UPSTREAM.md). No CPU emulation/JIT.
- Python venv installed only Capstone 5.0.7 (native arm64 wheel).

## Native build progress
- Fully extracted 2,267 disc files into ignored `local/assets/` for runtime I/O.
- `tools/pipeline.py` reproduces prepare/assets/analyze/lift stages, pinned to upstream.
- Disassembly recovered 4,627 functions (3,056 in main .text). C lift generated 689,660
  lines; 66 unresolved targets and 107 unsupported instruction instances are tracked.
- Generated unsupported instructions and unresolved calls now stop with diagnostics
  when reached, rather than silently skipping logic. See `patches/xboxrecomp-lifter.patch`.
- Generated ARM64 objects compile after handling a privileged debug-register move as
  an explicit unsupported-instruction diagnostic.
- Native host in `src/`; CMake build is `build/native`, max two jobs.
- Runtime port fixes are being saved in `patches/xboxrecomp-runtime.patch`.
- User permits helpful subagents. Controller agent implemented/tested native SDL2
  input and is inspecting D3D integration. Runtime agent fixes safe macOS mappings.
  Audio agent implements missing POSIX output/cadence.
- Homebrew libepoxy 1.5.10 installed (2.7 MB). SDL2 here is sdl2-compat over SDL3.

## First native boot (13:33 EDT)
- `build/native/wrath_native` links, 8.2 MB Mach-O arm64 executable.
- Real recompiled XBE entry executes memory/CRT initialization. Boot log:
  `local/reports/boot-01.log`. Exits through HalReturnToFirmware after kernel ordinal
  202 (`NtOpenFile`) returns C0000034. This is a game startup failure, not success.
- LLDB follow-up identifies failed path as bare `\\Device\\CdRom0`; path mapper only
  accepts a trailing slash. Runtime agent fixing actual device-root handling.
- Native controller virtual-device tests and audio dummy/CoreAudio tests pass.
  Physical controllers and in-game audio are not yet tested.
- Input agent identified exact XDK 4361 D3D API addresses using signature matches
  and local disassembly, implementing first four hooks in `src/graphics.c`.
- `tools/bootstrap.py` pins checkout, applies tracked patches without overwriting
  other local changes, and installs only the pinned Capstone dependency.

## Input fingerprints
- ISO SHA-256: `1caef217dd588655a851ce5ae3cdead912bf383ae86e574e9b33aa74c12900bc`
- XBE SHA-256: `e8d7cbf225d899eb88227c11d1f40434c34e27c1b23ed946fb2c3471168d2f4d`

## Current checkpoint (boot-08)
- Real native ARM64 entry and CRT execute. Disc root, optical media query, save
  directory opens, title metadata creation and sparse HDD metadata reads now pass.
- Safe guest runtime layout starts above the XBE image, avoiding its large .data.
  Sparse 4 GB virtual reservation has 64 MB of guest RAM; it is not 4 GB resident.
- Boot-06 reached first game main at 0x00087BF0 (LLDB breakpoint). No actual
  title/menu visible yet. Boot-07 crashes on NtDuplicateObject from game main: a
  current-thread pseudo handle was being treated as a native handle pointer. Fixed
  and tested independent duplicate lifetimes/current-thread identity; boot-08 passes.
- Boot-08 creates the real native 640x480 graphics device and a guest texture-level
  surface. It then stalls in the original D3D pushbuffer routine from render-state
  initialization (FD830 ->103740). Graphics agent is implementing the actual state
  boundary. No original-game title/menu pixels verified yet.
- Boot-05 aborts on a missing target inside CRT memmove 0xF5DD0: function discovery
  interpreted inline jump-table data as instructions. Native audited cdecl memmove
  bridge added; overlap/alignment/stack tests and boot-06 confirm the fix.
- Native D3D create/clear/swap, texture/VB and non-indexed draw bridges are integrated.
  Synthetic textured-quad readback passes on GL4.1 Metal; this is not game rendering.
  Programmable shaders, indexed draws, render targets and other state need work.
- Seven native XAPI controller bridges integrated. Virtual-device tests pass;
  physical Bluetooth Xbox/DualSense testing remains pending.
- Native CoreAudio output works in isolated tests. Real game sound is not integrated;
  startup creates 252 Xbox ADPCM buffers, requiring decoding and lazy voice allocation.
- Runtime details: docs/RUNTIME.md. Graphics/input ABI evidence: D3D-INTEGRATION.md,
  INPUT-INTEGRATION.md. Build max two jobs; execute from local/run to contain logs.

## Next
Run the rebuilt native game through CRT/cache startup and stop on concrete faults.
Implement the next actually reached compatibility or translation gap, preserving
original game behavior. Keep all stubs/limitations explicit. Verify real title/menu
pixels and then gameplay/input before reporting success.

## Reproducible bounded boot
`python3 tools/boot.py boot-NN` writes the LLDB report under local/reports.
Use `--break-at sub_00087BF0` to verify game-main entry. Real crashes need LLDB
`-k` commands (the helper includes them); process exit 0 is not game success.
