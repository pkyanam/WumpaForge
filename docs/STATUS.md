# Status — 2026-09-08

## Goal
Run the supplied game natively on Apple Silicon without emulation. **Not running.**

## Environment
- Workspace started with only a 931 MiB ISO and `.DS_Store`; initialized Git on `main`.
- Host reports arm64. Xcode beta, Homebrew, Python 3, CMake, and SDL2 are present.
- Input: `Crash Bandicoot - The Wrath of Cortex (USA).iso` (preserved in place).
- `file` reports ISO 9660; exact platform/version still requires disc inspection.

## Initial upstream findings
- https://github.com/Open-Travelers/OpenCrashWOC : GameCube-derived C reimplementation,
  no releases, README says gamecode 70%, build WIP, incomplete engine and dummy sound.
- https://github.com/denzi-gh/crashwoc-decomp-ps2 : active matching decompilation targeting
  PAL v1.03 SLES-50386, not a native host port. No releases.
- https://github.com/denzi-gh/crashwoc-decomp-gc : matching GameCube USA decompilation,
  no releases; branches include multiplayer and custom text, no advertised native port.
- https://github.com/calmsacibis995/crash-ps2 : USA v1.00 project explicitly unbuildable
  and very incomplete.

## Next
Inspect ISO descriptors and identify executable/version. Inspect current source trees,
including native host scaffolding and missing dependencies, to establish a viable route.
No game process or build is currently running.
